GranmaHohidaysFeed
==================

Introduction
------------

This is an one page web site written in ruby/ramaze that give the last inorfmations about your familie holidays to your Granma.
The feeding of this page is done by twitter, mail, and instaMapper : you need only an Iphone to contribute...

No local storage needed. This page agregates :

* a twitter flow (one account + one hashtag) for 140 char messages !
* a instaMapper (http://www.instamapper.com/) google map with your last locations, in so far as you have activated the tracking system on IntaMapper GPS tracker Iphone App.
* a mail feed widget where you can post one picture in attachment for more than 140 chars messages.

GranmaHohidaysFeed has been tested with an Iphone (3GS). This could work with other smartphone, depending on InstaMapper compatibility.
